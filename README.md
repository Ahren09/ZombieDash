Have you watched the TV series "Walking Dead"? Or have you ever played Plants VS Zombies? 

In Zombie Dash, your human friends are trapped by zombies AGAIN!! Your glorious job is to salvage them before their BRAINS are BITTEN OFF by ZOMBIES!


# Intro

You play the role of **Penelope**, a zombie hunter. You need to trek through an abandoned building, rescuing frightened citizens before they are turned into brainless **Zombies**. On each level, you must lead all of the **Citizens** safely to the **Exits**, then head through an exit yourself so you can advance to the next level.

**Zombies** are blue. Some are **Dumb Zombies** and just wander around randomly, while others are **Smart Zombies** and will attempt to move toward you or **Citizens** if they get too close. 

Do not let the **Citizens** or yourself get too close to **Zombies**.
Any time either type of **Zombie** gets close enough to a person, the zombie may attempt to **Vomit**, which will soon turn the person into a BRAINLESS **Zombie**.

Avoid falling into **Pits**. A **Pit** can kill **Zombies** **Citizens** and you, the player!

Before it's too late, :
**Citizens**:      can get to the exit 
**Penelope** :   YES! You, the player, can use a vaccine. 

__ NOTICE: Only Penelope is clear-headed enough to use a vaccine on herself __

# Zombie Dash - 中文介绍

好嘞！现在是中文版！
你会发现刚才我英文版的游戏说明啰里八嗦，其实各位聪明绝顶的中国玩家朋友们早就猜到了游戏操作(￣∇￣)

## 操作
你只需知道
**WASD** 或 **8 4 2 6**
分别控制 **上左下右**

走到 **弹药箱** / **汽油桶** / **急救包** 上可以分别获得
**地雷** / **火焰喷射器** / **急救药**
不要掉进坑中，会直接挂彩哦 ; ) 

**Space**  发射火焰
**Tab**      布设地雷
**Enter**   使用解药

你不需要消灭所有的僵尸，但干掉僵尸会自动加分
你的目的，就是带领人质成功到达出口，然后自己也成功逃脱——Level Up！

游戏地图是可以修改的， 全部位于 **Asset** 文件夹下
文件名类似 "level01.txt"
