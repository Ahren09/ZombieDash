The following two are not needed in ActivatingObject class
	virtual ~ActivatingObject();
	virtual void doSomething();

Since the function that calls it passes in an Actor*
setInfectionStatus() must be defined in Actor class(which can be pure virtual function)
It can be redefined in Human class


I was thinking of putting clearInfection() in Penelope class, since a citizen's infection
status cannot be cleared once it's infected

void clearInfection()
{
    infectionCount=0;
    infectedStatus=false;
}

However, since infectedStatus is a private data member of Human class, I have no way to
access this variable aside from defining a function in Human class

Thus I define this function in Penelope class, and redefine it in Citizen class:
void clearInfection()
{}

so that a Citizen's infection status will never be erased accidentally
